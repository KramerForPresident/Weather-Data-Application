//quick pseudocode thing i drew out

for (number of requested date periods, given a single city){

	make entry call with that particular date range and city
	the REST call returns a the data that fills an entry array
}

we have a set of entry arrays (2 or 3 probably?)
return this data back to the chart component
	
then the chart itself graphs relevant information from entry array objects
